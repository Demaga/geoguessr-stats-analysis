# Overview

This repo contains a bunch of Jupyter notebooks that I use to analyze Geoguessr party games that I play with my friends.

The data comes from [Chrome extension](https://github.com/Demaga/geoguessr-stats) that collects data while playing the game.

You should run `1_resolve_countries.ipynb` first. It's kind of preprocessing step that generates .csv with combined data and resolved country names.
